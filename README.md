# Movie-Recommendation
In this machine learning project, we build a recommendation system from the ground up to suggest movies to the user based on his/her preferences.
# What is a Recommendation System?
Before moving on to build a recommender engine for movies, let’s discuss recommendation systems.

Recommendation systems are computer programs that suggest recommendations to users depending on a variety of criteria.

These systems estimate the most likely product that consumers will buy and that they will be interested in. Netflix, Amazon, and other companies use recommender systems to help their users find the right product or movie for them.

There are 3 types of recommendation systems.

### Demographic Filtering: 
The recommendations are the same for every user. They are generalized, not personalized. These types of systems are behind sections like “Top Trending”.
### Content-based Filtering: 
These suggest recommendations based on the item metadata (movie, product, song, etc). Here, the main idea is if a user likes an item, then the user will also like items similar to it.
### Collaboration-based Filtering: 
These systems make recommendations by grouping the users with similar interests. For this system, metadata of the item is not required.
